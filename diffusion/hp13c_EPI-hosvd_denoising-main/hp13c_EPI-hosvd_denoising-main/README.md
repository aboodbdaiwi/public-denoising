# hp13c_EPI-hosvd_denoising

This Github repository contains matlab codes for denoising hyperpolarized 13C MR images of the human brain using patch-based higher-order singular value decomposition and sample data from a healthy brain volunteer and simulations. The description of the method and results can be found in the paper published in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (doi: 10.1002/mrm.28887.)

- The 'GL-HOSVD' folder contains matlab function codes for the patch-based denoising and kinetic rate fitting.
